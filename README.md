# 🧠 ColdReach AI

**AI-powered outreach that values quality over quantity.**  
ColdReach AI helps students, job seekers, and developers connect more effectively with **startups and professionals** by crafting authentic, personalized cold emails.  
The system automatically scrapes company and user data, finds the most relevant contact using the Apollo API, generates thoughtful drafts with GPT, and uses a lightweight ML model to ensure every message feels specific, relevant, and human before it’s ever sent.

## 🚀 Overview

Connecting with startups and professionals can be difficult — researching companies, finding the right person, and writing personalized outreach messages takes hours.  
Most “AI outreach” tools solve this by blasting generic templates.  
ColdReach AI takes the opposite approach: it **automates the research and writing**, but adds an **ML quality gate** and **real contact discovery** to ensure every message is thoughtful, targeted, and worth sending.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User uploads their profile once:**
   - Resume (PDF)
   - LinkedIn URL
   - GitHub URL  
   ColdReach scrapes and summarizes these sources to understand the user’s skills, projects, and interests.  
   This user profile is stored securely (e.g., in AWS S3 or a database) and reused for future generations unless the user requests an update.

2. **User enters a company link:**  
   - ColdReach scrapes the company’s website (“About” page, meta tags, key paragraphs).  
   - Summarizes what the company does and extracts relevant keywords.

3. **Apollo API integration:**  
   - ColdReach queries the **Apollo.io database** to identify the most relevant contact (e.g., Head of Recruiting, CTO, or Project Lead).  
   - Returns the name, position, and email address of the best contact to reach out to.

4. **GPT-4 generates a draft:**  
   - Using the user’s profile + company summary + contact info, GPT creates a short, personalized cold email connecting the user’s experience to the company’s work.

5. **ML personalization scoring:**  
   - A TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model evaluates how specific, relevant, and personal the draft is.  
   - If the score is below a set threshold, ColdReach regenerates or refines the email.

6. **Send and track:**  
   - Once the draft passes the quality check, ColdReach sends it via **AWS SES**.  
   - Every email is logged (company, contact, score, and status) for analytics and improvement.

## 🧩 Personalization Model

ColdReach’s ML model acts as a **content gatekeeper** — it ensures that generated emails are specific, relevant, and human-like.

It distinguishes between:
- ✅ **Personalized:** Mentions the company name or project, relates the sender’s background to their work, or references something factual.  
- ❌ **Generic:** Repetitive, vague, or sounds like a template.

Using TF-IDF text embeddings and Logistic Regression, the model produces a **personalization score (0–1)**.  
Emails below the set threshold (default 0.6) trigger a regeneration loop until the quality bar is met.

## 📊 Analytics & Insights

ColdReach tracks each email’s:
- Personalization score  
- Contact role and industry  
- Status (Sent, Opened, Replied, No Response)  
- Timestamps and response latency  

### From these metrics, the dashboard visualizes:
- Reply rate and open rate trends  
- Score vs. reply rate correlation  
- Top-performing industries and roles  
- Optimal send times and average response times  

### How it helps:
- **Users** see what kinds of messages and targets work best.  
- **You** (the developer) can retrain your ML model using real feedback.  
- **Future versions** can predict reply likelihood based on past data.

## 📊 Example Use Case

A student uploads their resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub once.  
They paste `https://clearcutar.com` into ColdReach.  
The app scrapes that ClearCutAR builds AR imaging software for surgical wound care.  
Apollo identifies “Lisa Chen — CTO” as the best contact.  
GPT writes:  

> “Hi Lisa, I loved your team’s work on AR imaging at ClearCutAR — I recently built a project that uses AI for real-time image processing…”  

The ML model scores it **0.84** → passes → ColdReach sends via **AWS SES**.  
The system logs: company, contact, email text, personalization score, and send status for analytics.
